# Hackerrank News Search

This is a practice project I build after being inspired by the article [6 Fun React Projects You Can Build Today](https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/). Its purpose is to provide search functionality for Hackerrank News ([HackerRank Blog](https://blog.hackerrank.com/)). This way, users can search through stories, comments, and polls very quickly. Results instantly appear, and if available, users can click on a button to visit the original website.
